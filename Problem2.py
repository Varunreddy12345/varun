insights = """
- **Admissions and Enrollments**: We observe fluctuating trends in applications and admissions, with specific seasons (Spring/Fall) showing higher activity.
- **Retention and Satisfaction Trends**: Retention and satisfaction show a relatively steady upward or downward trend, and departments like Engineering have high retention rates.
- **Department Analysis**: Engineering and Business departments tend to have higher enrollments compared to Arts and Science.
- **Spring vs Fall**: Thereâ€™s a noticeable increase in applications during the Fall, while Spring often shows a smaller peak.
- **Actionable Insights**: Consider targeted efforts in retention and student satisfaction for Spring intakes, especially in departments with lower satisfaction scores.
